# ExpressionEngine Wiki

The ExpressionEngine Wiki provides a powerful wiki that integrates seamlessly with ExpressionEngine. See the Wiki [wiki](https://github.com/EllisLab/Wiki/wiki) (wiki!) for a more detailed explanation of what a wiki is and what you can do with it. 

The Wiki Module requires ExpressionEngine to function.
